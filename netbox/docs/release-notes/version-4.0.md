## v4.0.0 (2024-05-06)

!!! tip "Plugin Maintainers"
    Please see the dedicated [plugin migration guide](../plugins/development/migration-v4.md) for a checklist of changes that may be needed to ensure compatibility with NetBox v4.0.

### Breaking Changes

* Support for Python 3.8 and 3.9 has been removed.
* The format for GraphQL query filters has changed. Please see the GraphQL documentation for details and examples.
* The deprecated `device_role` & `device_role_id` filters for devices have been removed. (Use `role` and `role_id` instead.)
* The obsolete `device_role` field has been removed from the REST API serializer for devices. (Use `role` instead.)
* The legacy reports functionality has been dropped. Reports will be automatically converted to custom scripts on upgrade.
* The `parent` and `parent_id` filters for locations now return only immediate children of the specified location. (Use `ancestor` and `ancestor_id` to return _all_ descendants.)
* The `object_type` field on the CustomField model has been renamed to `related_object_type`.
* The `utilities.utils` module has been removed and its resources reorganized into separate modules organized by function.
* The obsolete `NullableCharField` class has been removed. (Use Django's stock `CharField` class with `null=True` instead.)
* The `annotated_date` template filter and `annotated_now` template tag have been removed.

### New Features

#### Complete UI Refresh ([#12128](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/12128))

The NetBox user interface has been completely refreshed and updated. This massive effort entailed:

* Refactoring the base HTML templates
* Moving from Boostrap 5.0 to Bootstrap 5.3
* Adopting the [Tabler](https://tabler.io/) UI theme
* Replacing slim-select with [Tom-Select](https://tom-select.js.org/)
* Displaying additional object attributes in dropdown form fields
* Enabling opt-in HTMX-powered navigation (see [#14736](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/14736))
* Widespread cleanup & standardization of UI components

#### Dynamic REST API Fields ([#15087](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/15087))

The REST API now supports specifying which fields to include in the response data. For example, the response to a request for

```
GET /api/dcim/sites/?fields=name,status,region,tenant
```

will include only the four specified fields in the representation of each site. Additionally, the underlying database queries effected by such requests have been optimized to omit fields which are not included in the response, resulting in a substantial performance improvement.

#### Strawberry GraphQL Engine ([#9856](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/9856))

The GraphQL engine has been changed from using Graphene-Django to Strawberry-Django. Changes include:

* Queryset Optimizer - reduces the number of database queries when querying related tables
* Updated GraphiQL Browser
* The format for GraphQL query filters and lookups has changed. Please see the GraphQL documentation for details and examples.

#### Advanced Form Rendering Functionality ([#14739](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/14739))

New resources have been introduced to enable advanced form rendering without a need for custom HTML templates. These include:

* FieldSet - Represents a grouping of form fields (replaces the use of lists/tuples)
* InlineFields - Multiple fields rendered on a single row
* TabbedGroups - Fieldsets rendered under navigable tabs within a form
* ObjectAttribute - Renders a read-only representation of a particular object attribute (for reference)

#### Legacy Admin UI Disabled ([#12325](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/12325))

The legacy admin user interface is now disabled by default, and the few remaining views it provided have been relocated to the primary UI. NetBox deployments which still depend on the legacy admin functionality for plugins can enable it by setting the `DJANGO_ADMIN_ENABLED` configuration parameter to true.
